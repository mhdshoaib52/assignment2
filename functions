Q1. Which keyword is used to create a function? Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in the
range of 1 to 25.
def is a keyword used to create a function.
def odd_number(n):
    return[x for x in range(n+1) if x%2==1]
print(odd_number(25))
Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs to
demonstrate their use.
 special symbol used for arguments *args (Non-Keyword Arguments) **kwargs (Keyword Arguments) 
 def test22(*args):
    for a in args:
        print(a)
test22('shoaib','is','coder')
o/p;-shoaib
is
coder

def test22(args,*kwargs):
    print('first argument:',args)
    for a in args:
        print(a)
test22('shoaib','is','coder')
o/p;-
first argument: shoaib
s
h
o
a
i
b

Q3. What is an iterator in python? Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the method
used for iteration. Use these methods to print the first five elements of the given list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,
18, 20].
iterator is used to iterate though lists tupels 
def printValues():
	l = list()
	for i in range(2,20):
		l.append(i**2)
	print(l[:5])
	print(l[-5:])

printValues()

Q4. What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator
function.
A generator is a kind of function that returns an object called a generator object which can return a series of values rather than a single value.
 when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don't want to store the entire sequence in memory.
 def GeneratorFun():
    yield 1           
    yield 2           
    yield 3           
  

for value in GeneratorFun():
    print(value)
    
 Q5. Create a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000. Use the next() method to print the
first 20 prime numbers.
